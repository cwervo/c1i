        <h1>Core 1: Interaction</h1>
        <h3>Parsons School of Design</h3>
        <h3>Fall 2024</h3>
        <h3>Taught By: Andres Cuervo</h3>
        <h3>Time: Tuesdays, 9:00am - 11:40am</h3>
        <h3>Location: Parsons 2 W 13th, <b>Room 1111</b></h3>

        Core 1: Interaction is designed to introduce students to programming as a creative mediumâ€”as a way of making and exploring. The coursework
        focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are
        encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques, ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects
        designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a
        learning-through-making approach to technical skill building. Historical and current interaction design precedents will be discussed.
